#### SBB_00008_issuefiles
The text files contained in this folder contain the full text of the Issue in the file name. For example, `19360424_1-0001.txt` contains the text for the April 24th, 1936 issue, page 1.
The text is formatted in the same column format as the original issue. There may be typos in these files due to the OCR technology. 
If you do any editing on these files we would greatly appreciate contributions of those edits to the repository.
 

#### SBB_00008_articlefiles
The text files contained in this folder contain the newspaper issues split up by article.  They are named in the same conventions as the issue files with the additional article tag.
For example, `19360424_1-0001_ARTICLE01.txt` contains the first article of the April 24th, 1936 issue.
These files also contain ARTICLE00 files. These are the header of the April 24th, 1936 issue (`19360424_1-0001_ARTICLE00.txt`).
Additionally, there are ARTICLE_TITLES files (`19360424_1-0001_ARTICLE_TITLES.txt`). There is one article file to correspond to each issue. 
Due to some formatting problems (spacing, commas, etc) not all of the articles titles were found despite being present. The article file gives the article number, the article title and whether it was found.
Unfortunately, a few of these issues did not include article metadata. If this is the case, all of the text got dumped into a file with the tag ARTICLE.txt and the ARTICLE_TITLES file will be empty.
